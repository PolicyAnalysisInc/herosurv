\title{Define Royston & Parmar Spline Survival Distribution}
\usage{
define_surv_spline(scale, ...)

define_spline_survival(scale, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{scale}{"hazard", "odds", or "normal", as described
in flexsurvspline. With the default of no knots in
addition to the boundaries, these models reduce to the
Weibull, log-logistic and log-normal respectively. The
scale must be common to all times.}

\item{...}{parameters and knot log times of spline distribution,
which can be provided either in order starting with spline
parameters followed by knot log times, or by names (e.g
gamma1, gamma2, ... gammaN, knots1, knots2, ... knotsN). See
examples below for named and unnamed calls.}
}
\value{
a \code{surv_spline} object.
